# FusionSidsAPI

Ill make a readme later lol
I renamed it from Image generation api to sids api since i plan on adding more than just images to this

If you look in the [assets](https://github.com/FusionSid/FusionSidsAPI/tree/master/assets) folder you will see a list of images/memes im gonna be using for this.

Currently theres 67 images in that folder,
I plan on having 69 endpoints so I need to find 2 more memes if you find something good:
